				Join us for 5 days of fun running at the South Eugene track and surrounding areas! Camp activities will include group running, games, relays, drills, fun strength exercises, frolicking, yoga, and racing. Camp counselors will be members of the SEHS XC team. Professional athletes from the community will make guest appearances to speak to campers about important aspects of running such as nutrition, recovery, and even racing strategies. This camp is a great opportunity for elementary and middle school students with and without running experience to learn about the sport of running and get in some fun summer exercise! Also you get a T shirt!
