				Join us for 5 days of running, playing games and learning about cross country with South Eugene cross country runners! Kids will be separated into age groups, participate in age-appropriate activities and games, and will get finish off the week with a fun cross country race on nearby soccer fields. Kids will also hear from professional athletes and coaches from the community, including Team Run Eugene, and Oregon Track Club Elite.
			  </p>
			        Activities will include yoga, learning how to properly warm up, running technique, relays, obstacle courses, and more! Camp counselors will be current South Eugene cross country runners. This camp is a great opportunity for 1st-8th graders with or without running experience to learn about the sport of running and get some fun exercise!
